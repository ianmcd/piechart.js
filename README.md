piechart.js
===========

piechart.js is a very lightweight JQuery script for creating basic css3 piecharts -- originally used in depicting the relevance of a search result.

It's very simple to use:

First, style the included css file to your liking - background color / size, etc.

Then create an html file with the following code(after linking the appropriate .js and .css files) where you would like the piechart to be generated:

The above assumes you didn't rename the css class in the stylesheet(if you have, you will need to rename it in the jquery file as well). The title is the percent you wish to have shown.

It's that easy.
